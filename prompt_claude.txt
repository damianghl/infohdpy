So I am writing a python package to estimate mutual information with a novel method which I call infoHDP. 
I have put everything within a single file info_hdp.py (attached): how to calculate entropy and mutual information given the probabilities, some functions to generate different probabilities distributions and generate samples from them, naive methods to calculate entropy and info based on frequency estimation of probabilities, a specific method to calculate entropy called NSB (previously developed) and some auxiliary functions to use this method to estimate mutual information indirectly through entropies, and our specific functions to estimate mutual information based on beta priors for the conditional distribution (which are divided in two sets of functions, one for binary labels for variable y, and a more general case for multiple labels for y). 
I am reorganizing the package so that it can be more modular and it is easy to expand/modify in the future. My new strucutre looks like this:
infohdp/
    __init__.py
    core.py
    estimators/
        __init__.py
        base.py
        naive.py
        nsb.py
        infohdp.py
        binary_infohdp.py
        multiclass_infohdp.py
    generators/
        __init__.py
        probability.py
        sample.py
    utils.py
    constants.py
    tests/
        __init__.py
        test_core.py
        test_estimators/
            __init__.py
            test_naive.py
            test_nsb.py
            test_infohdp.py
            test_binary_infohdp.py
            test_multiclass_infohdp.py
        test_generators/
            __init__.py
            test_probability.py
            test_sample.py
        test_utils.py
Can you help me in this new structure to implement these functions: infohdp/estimators/infohdp.py, infohdp/estimators/binary_infohdp.py, infohdp/estimators/multiclass_infohdp.py?

InfoHDPEstimator: Implements my novel InfoHDP method
BinaryInfoHDPEstimator: Specific to binary Y labels
MulticlassInfoHDPEstimator: For multiple Y labels

Attaching infohdp/__init__.py, infohdp/utils.py, infohdp/estimators/__init__.py and infohdp/estimators/base.py for context.
